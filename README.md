## 1. Bind a systemd service or process to specific CPU(s)

When working on **ARM big.LITTLE architectures** (or any multi-core CPU), you may want to bind services or processes to specific CPU cores for better performance or isolation.

You can add the `CPUAffinity` directive under the `[Service]` section of your systemd unit file:

```ini
[Service]
ExecStart=/path/to/your/app
CPUAffinity=6 7
```

You can also bind a process manually using taskset:
```bash
taskset -c 6,7 python3 main.py
```
